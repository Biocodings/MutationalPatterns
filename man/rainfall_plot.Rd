\description{
Rainfall plot visualizes the types of mutations and intermutation distance
}
\details{
Rainfall plots can be used to visualize the distribution of mutations along the genome or a subset of chromosomes. 
The distance of a mutation with the mutation prior to it (the intermutation distance) is plotted on the y-axis on a log scale. 
The colour of the points indicates the base substitution type.
Clusters of mutations with lower intermutation distance represent mutation hotspots.
